# SurrConformalDR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SurrConformalDR is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of SurrConformalDR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Gaochenyin/SurrConformalDR")
```

## Example

We illustrate the usage of `SurrConformalDR` using simple synthetic
datasets for continuous primary outcomes

``` r

                        beta.S = 10)
